## Summary
The purpose of this project is to let the user search for a city and display the weather of that city. Included in the weather is the temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index, as well as a weather icon for the current weather conditions. Additionally, a five day forecast is displayed with dates, weather icons, temperature, and humidity. Each city searched is loaded into a city history list, and generates button elements that can be clicked to load the respective city's weather data.
